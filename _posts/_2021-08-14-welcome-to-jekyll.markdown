Youâ€™ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:



This is $\color{red}{Red}$, $\textcolor{red}{Red}$. <span style="color:blue">some *blue* text</span>.

## Math
### Theorem
Use HTML `div` with `class='theorem'` and optional attribute `text='name'`.
<div class='theorem' text='Homothety'>
For two triangles $ABC$ and $A'B'C'$, which have parallel corresponding sides, the
lines $AA'$, $BB'$ and $CC'$, which join the vertices with the corresponding equal angles, either pass through a common point and the triangles are homothetic, or are parallel and the triangles are
congruent.
</div>
